			Hi there! Welcome to my travelogue, this is a small virtual tour of some of my favourite places I like to go to in nature
			that are all in Alberta!  Every place is worth a trip at least once in your life if you love the outdoors and also just live in Calgary and are close by!

		<!--FISH CREEK SECTION-->
	<section  id="Fish-Creek-Park">
	  	<header> <h2> Fish Creek Park </h2> </header>
			<img src="FishCreekPark.jpg" width="420" height="350" alt="A photo of a bike path, with trees covering the right half of the image, the left half is just the blue sky."> 

			<p> Fish Creek Park is one of my favourite places, growing up in Calgary it wasn't often that we would go camping or take a trip out to Canmore or the Mountains. So growing up, I loved going to fish creek to get some fresh air.</p>
			<p> I lived very close to fish creek for a number of years in my life, so whenever I was feeling down or just wanted to get out of the house I could walk just down the road and just be in the woods in the middle of the city, which was and still is pretty cool!</p>
			<p> I have seen a number of animals during my walks in Fish Creek, from deer to beavers, owls, coyotes, and I think there has even been a bear siting before!</p>

			<h3> <u>Know before you go</u></h3>
			<ol> 
				<li>There are many entrances to Fish Creek all over Calgary!  If its spring or especially summer, make sure you bring bug spray!  Either I am a mosquito magnet or there really is just an abundance of mosquitos in the park.</li>
				<li>Bring a camera, you never know when you will run into something beautiful, like an animal or even the sunset. </li>
				<li>Theres many places to have picnics / barbecues! Bring snacks and some water! </li>
			</ol>

		<!--KOOTENAY SECTION-->
	<section  id="Kootenay">
		<header> <h2> Kootenay River </h2> </header>
    	<p>
			The Kootenay river is not as easy to get to as the other places, I am lucky enough to have an adventurous family and partner.  My Mom and Stepdad took me on a canoe trip down the Kootenay river when I was younger. And I have since gone on 3 more rafting trips down it with my partner!
		</p>
		<p>
			The Kootenay is absolutely one of the most beautiful places I have seen.  The mountain ranges, the fishing, the wildlife, the camping, and the memories I have made from my time on the river are those I will remember for a lifetime.
		</p>
		<h3><u>Know before you go</u></h3>
		<ol>
			<li>If you want to go ON the river, occasionally there are river guides in thet summertime, otherwise you have to buy yourself a Canoe or Raft and float down with some friends. </li>
			<li>Obviously, always wear a life jacket.</li>
			<li>Never go alone it can be very danagerous, especially if you have never guided a boat before.</li>
		</ol>

		<!--BRAGG CREEK SECTION-->
	
	<section  id="Bragg-Creek">
	  <header> <h2> Bragg Creek </h2> </header>
    	<img src="Bragg-Creek.jpg" width="430" height="350" alt="It's a image of the forest in Bragg Creek, some of the sky is poking through the trees, but most of the image is of the forest floor, there are some pink wildflowers poking through.">
			<p> Bragg Creek is a cute Hamlet about 45 minutes from Calgary, there are lots of hikes to go on, campsites nearby, and also Cabins to rent! </p>
			<p> I honestly haven't been to Bragg creek a lot, but I remember always driving through it as a kid, so I remember it fondly. I have done a number of hikes around the area, and all of which are just beautiful and relatively beginner friendly as it's in the foothills.</p>
			<h3><u>Know before you go</u></h3>
			<ol>
				<li> Again, wear your bugspray in the summer or you will be eaten alive!</li>
				<li> Bring bear spray and make sure you know how to use it!</li>
				<li> Pack yourself some snacks, water, and sunscreen because although there is lots of forest you can still get sunburnt!</li>
			</ol>
